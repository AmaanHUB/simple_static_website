		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> Hello, my name is Amaan Hashmi-Ubhi and I have recently graduated from the University Of Birmingham (UK) with a BSc (Hons.) in Biomedical Science where I also undertook a Year In Computer Science. My specialism tends to be anything related to Linux since I have a wealth of knowledge and research skills that can be applied to many situations. For a full portfolio of what I have done, my projects, and what I can do, please see my <b>Profile</b> page.
